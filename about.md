Hi, I'm Alex. I work as a developer at [UVD](http://uvd.co.uk/) where I build web apps. I also dabble in a bit of Python, Android, dev-ops and most recently, [Elixr](http://elixir-lang.org/). I studied Computing (BSc) at The University of the West of England.

When I'm not at work, you can find me cycling/running, fixing things, watching Netflix or occasionally skiing.


**Skills**

Programming:

* PHP
* Symfony2/3
* Python
* Java/Android
 
Other:

* Git
* SQL
* AWS/Linux server administration
* HTML/CSS

Symfony/LEMP is my default stack and tend to write in PHPStorm using the Vim plugin.
